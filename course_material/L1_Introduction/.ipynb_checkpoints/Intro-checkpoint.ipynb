    "OpenCL (short for Open Computing Language) is an open standard for running compute workloads on many different kinds of compute hardware (e.g CPUs, GPU's). The OpenCL trademark is held by Apple, and the standard is developed and released by the [Khronos](https://www.khronos.org) group, a non-for-profit organisation that provides a focal point for the development of royalty-free standards such as OpenGL. The OpenCL specification itself is just a document, and can be downloaded from the Khronos website [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/). It is then the task of compute hardware vendors to produce software implementations of OpenCL that best make use of their compute devices."

    "## How does OpenCL work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer how an OpenCL implementation works, we need to start thinking about hardware. In every compute device such as a CPU or GPU there are a number of cores on which software can be run. In OpenCL terminology these cores are called **Compute Units**. Each Compute Unit makes available to the operating system a number of hardware threads that can run software. In OpenCL terminology we call these hardware threads **Processing Elements**. For example, an NVIDIA GP102 die is shown below. Each die contains 30 compute units, shown contained by the orange squares. Each compute unit provides 128 processing elements (CUDA cores), so in this example there are $30\\times128 = 3840$ processing elements available for use in compute applications. \n",

Every point in the Grid is called a **work-item** and represents a unique invocation of the kernel. A work-item is equivalent to a single kernel invocation. This is much like defining an execution space using nested loops, however with OpenCL there are no guarantees on the order in which work items are completed.\n",

    "The first is the **Platform**. This is a software representation of the vendor. A platform provides access to all **devices** that the platform supports. During device discovery, available platforms must be queried before anything else. A platform provides access to one or more compute devices and possibly even a mixture of accelerator devices from the same vendor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Device** provides a way to query the capabilites of the compute device and provides a foundation to build a context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surrounding the devices is a **Context**. A Context is like a registry that keeps track of everything (i.e kernel executions and memory allocations) that are happening on the compute device/s. A context is constructed on using both a platform and one or more devices on the platform. There are some benefits (such as memory copies) that could be obtained by encapsulating one or more devices under the same context, however this assumes that devices must belong to the same platform - an assumption which may not be true. A simpler and more general design is to create a unique context for every compute device.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context are **Buffers**. Buffers are memory allocations managed under the context, and may exist on either the host or the compute device. At runtime memory is migrated to where is needed, but you can have some control over where the buffer lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "At runtime, source code for the kernels is collated into a **Program**, and the program is compiled for every device in a context. There must be a program for every context, and every program must be compiled with knowledge of the associated devices under the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a context has been created and devices are known, then one can create one or more **Command queue/s** for each device. A command queue is a place to submit work, such as kernel invocations and memory copies. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Kernel** is a component of a compiled **Program**. At runtime we set the arguments of compiled kernels and then submit kernels to command queues for execution. We can keep track of the status of a command submitted to the command queue using an **Event**.\n",

    "## Specification Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL) OpenCL was originally designed by Apple, who developed a proposal to submit to the Khronos group and holds the trademarks to OpenCL. The first specification, OpenCL 1.0, was ratified on November 18, 2008 and the first public release of the standard was on December 2008. Since then a number of different versions of the standard have been released. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 1.1** introduced thread safety so that calls to most OpenCL functions from different threads didn't introduce race conditions. If memory allocations in buffers are used to represent 2D and 3D arrays, then Version 1.1 introduced routines to copy rectangular regions of those buffers to and from the host. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 1.2** is probably the most significant release of OpenCL. It remained the defacto OpenCL standard for at least 10 years. Abilities such as being able to divide the processing elements of a compute device into sub-devices that share a common cache and offline compilation of kernels were useful. Having math operations conform to the IEEE754 precision standard meant consistent results across heterogeneous compute architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 2.0** introduced support for Shared Virtual Memory (SVM). Implementation of SVM meant we no longer needed to qualify which space (i.e global, local..) a memory allocation belonged to, and memory could be transferred to and from devices transparently to the user. This was too much for some vendors to implement however, and a few vendor implementations remained at 1.2 for a number of years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 2.1** brought the SPIR-V (Standard Portable Intermediate Representation) language to OpenCL. During compilation a open-source compiler can take C or C++ kernel code and emit a compiled program as SPIR-V intermediate code. At runtime this program is loaded by the application and passed to the vendor driver for further compilation to binary code that can run on the compute device. This is a significant advancement, because if a vendor can implement support for SPIR-V then it dramatically reduces the number of intermediate representations the vendor compiler must support. It also offloads support for kernel language advancements to the open source compiler and provides a measure of security against intellectual property theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 2.2** allowed kernels to be produced using a subset of the C++14 standard. It also updated support for SPIR-V to version 1.2. The combination of shared virtual memory, C++ kernels, and SPIR-V support meant that very few vendors actually succeeded in producing viable implementations of OpenCL 2.2, and OpenCL stagnated for a period of 5 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Version 3.0** addressed the issue of stagnation by making Version 1.2 standard and all the other improvements in Version 2.x optional. This gave vendors freedom to implement what they wanted for customers and gave the standard some breathing room. Version 3.0 also introduced a new C++ language for kernels (called C++ for OpenCL) that uses a subset of the C++17 standard. The Clang compiler supports compilation of C++ for OpenCL kernels into SPIR-V format.\n",

We just need to link against a single library file called the **Installable Client Driver (ICD)** that may be provided by any vendor. The ICD has the name (**opencl.dll**) on Windows and (**libOpenCL.so**) on Linux. Accompanying the ICD are header files (**opencl.h** for C and **cl.hpp** for C++) that must be \"included\" from the C/C++ source code. The ICD takes care of intercepting all OpenCL library calls and routing them to the appropriate vendor implementation. The routing process happens transparently to the user. "
