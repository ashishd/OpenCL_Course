    "# OpenCL data types\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the survival C++ notebook that some C datatypes are represented with a nominal number of bits depending on the platform and operating system in use. Within OpenCL kernels, a particular C datatype always uses the same number of bits, however in the main program that same C datatype might use a different number of bits. This is a problem for OpenCL applications, which promise a level of portability across implementations. In order to remedy this, the latest [OpenCL C specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/pdf/OpenCL_C.pdf) has a number of standard data types for fixing the number of bits used, and maintaining consitency with the number of bits used for types in the kernel. As follows is a number of commonly used OpenCL data types and how many bits they use. It is **good practice** to use these data types wherever practical in OpenCL applications."
