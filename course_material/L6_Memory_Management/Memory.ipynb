    "From the introduction we know that Buffers are allocated on the host and they are migrated in and out of the compute device when they are needed. Here are some ways we can create Buffers and transfer memory in and out of them. \n",

    "\n",
    "Thus far we have been creating Buffers with the [clCreateBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clCreateBuffer.html) function using the **CL_MEM_READ_WRITE** flag. For example, this code creates a Buffer that has read-write access from the kernel, but no additional functionality.\n",

    "```C++\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### IO permission flags\n",
    "\n",
    "We can choose other IO flags to let the OpenCL implementation how the Buffer is to be used. This may unlock additional optimisations.\n",

    "| **Allocation flag** | **Functionality** | \n",
    "| :- | :- | \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Using host memory\n",
    "\n",
    "The flag **CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR** allows the Buffer to use host memory as the backing store for a Buffer. One must make sure that there is enough host memory allocated to cover the memory used by the buffer and that the host memory is not de-allocated while the buffer is using it. OpenCL implementations are free to allocate caches on the compute device for temporary usage and then synchronize as required. Memory synchronization can be explicitly done using **mapping**, which will be discussed shortly.\n",

    "Similarly, the flag **CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR** creates an OpenCL buffer but copies memory from a host pointer during buffer creation. After the copy finishes, the host pointer is then released.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both **CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR** and **CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR** require a host pointer to be passed into the call to [clCreateBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clCreateBuffer.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating buffers for asynchronous copies\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinned memory is host memory that cannot be paged out to swap. It enables fast Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers from the host, however it is limited by the OS to a fraction of the available memory. Normally, transfers between host and device - for example using [clEnqueueReadBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clEnqueueReadBuffer.html) or [clEnqueueWriteBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clEnqueueReadBuffer.html) - are synchronous, meaning they actually block until the transfer completes. The flag **CL_MEM_ALLOC_HOST_PTR** allocates pinned memory on the host as the backing store for the OpenCL buffer. This also enables asynchronous transfers so that IO movement can occur at the same time as compute."

It is important to remember that the word **\"row\"** in the documentation is the dimension along which memory is contiguous. Row pitch is the number of bytes along a row of **the memory allocation**, and slice pitch is the number of bytes in a slice of **the memory allocation**. Within the memory allocation a **region** is selected for the copy, it is of size (nbytes along the row, nrows, nslices). If you are only doing a 2D copy then use a value of 1 for **nslices**. The copy can be located at an **origin** within the memory allocation, this has units of (offset in bytes along a row, row id, slice id). Row id and slice id's start at 0. \n",

    "#### Buffer mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "With the contiguous and rectangular copies there are two memory spaces in use, one for the OpenCL buffer and one for the host. It is possible to map (or make available) an OpenCL buffer as an allocation of host memory, thus avoiding the explicit memory transfer. This approach can be particularly beneficial when a CPU or integrated GPU is employed, as the memory for the buffer is already on the host and no actual transfer from the device is needed. Buffer mapping can be useful for GPU's as well. With buffer mapping the OpenCL implementation has the opportunity to optimise transfers and synchronisation between OpenCL buffer and host. The command [clEnqueueMapBuffer](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clEnqueueMapBuffer.html) maps an OpenCL buffer into host memory. It uses the following mapping flags:\n",

The [clEnqueueUnmapMemObject](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clEnqueueUnmapMemObject.html) function unmaps the memory from the host and makes it available to kernels again."
