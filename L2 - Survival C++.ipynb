    "The IEEE754 standard for floating point numbers was established in 1985 and is the standard used in many applications, including OpenCL implementations. The bits are laid out in three sections: a Sign bit, an Exponent, and a Mantissa. The Sign bit occupies one bit, the Exponent has **NBE** bits and the Mantissa has **NBM** bits. The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The Exponent **E** is just an unsigned integer created by a dot product of the Exponent bits with a vector of decreasing positive powers of 2 ranging from $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}$ to $2^0$. The Mantissa is constructed the same way, but the value is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the Mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

The stride for each dimension is encapsulated in the strides vector **S**. In this example **S** = (8,2,1) for row-major and **S** = (1,3,12) for column-major representations. For any (zero-based) coordinate vector **C** the position **P** in the underlying memory allocation is just the dot product between the coordinate vector and the strides vector.\n",
