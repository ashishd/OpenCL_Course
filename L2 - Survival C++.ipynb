    "The IEEE754 standard for floating point numbers was established in 1985 and is the standard used in many applications, including OpenCL implementations. The bits are laid out in three sections: a Sign bit, an Exponent, and a Mantissa. The Sign bit occupies one bit, the Exponent has **NBE** bits and the Mantissa has **NBM** bits. The total number of bits for a floating point number is then NBE+NBM+1. The Exponent **E** is just an unsigned integer created by a dot product of the Exponent bits with a vector of decreasing positive powers of 2 ranging from $2^{\\mathrm{NBE}-1}$ to $2^0$. The Mantissa is constructed the same way, but the value is $2^{0}==1$ plus the dot product of the Mantissa bits with a vector of decreasing powers of 2 ranging from $2^{-1}$ to $2^{-\\mathrm{NBM}}$. All three components combine together to form the value, as shown below."

In such cases we can allocate memory at runtime from a large pool of available memory called the **heap**. Two functions to reserve memory are **[calloc](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/calloc/)** and **[malloc](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/malloc/)**. I prefer calloc because unlike malloc it always initialises the memory contents with zeros. Memory allocation with calloc looks like the following:\n",

Fortunately we don't need multi-dimensional indexing machinery, all we need to do is think of the memory allocation as if it were \"folded\" into a higher-dimensional structure. Shown below is a memory allocation of 24 elements. Below it are two 3D arrays of size **N** = (3,4,2), constructed by regarding the memory allocation as if it were \"folded\" according **row-major** and **column-major** ordering.\n",

    "If you look carefully with the folded representations you can see that a step by 1 along any dimension corresponds to a **stride** of 1 or more elements in the 1D array. For example a step of 1 along dimension 1 requires a **stride of 2** elements in row-major ordering and **3** elements in column-major ordering. The stride for each dimension is encapsulated in the strides vector **S**. In this example **S** = (8,2,1) for row-major and **S** = (1,3,12) for column-major representations. For any (zero-based) coordinate vector **C** the position **P** in the underlying memory allocation is just the dot product between the coordinate vector and the strides vector.\n",
